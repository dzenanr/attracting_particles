##attracting_particles 

**Categories**: education, canvas, circle, lines, distance, random.

**Description**: 
There are some particles on the canvas which start attracting each other when 
they come close. They will start drawing lines between them as they come closer 
to each other. The opacity of the lines depends upon the distance between the 
corresponding particles. If the distance is larger, then the opacity will be 
lower.
